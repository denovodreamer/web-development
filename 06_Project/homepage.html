    <div id="typography">
        The wind whispered through the trees, carrying with it the scent of rain. As the first drops fell,
        the world seemed to pause, holding its breath. The sky darkened, and a soft rumble echoed in the distance.
        It was a moment of quiet anticipation, where nature waited, poised between stillness and storm.
